                       11:00 A.M., November 17th, 2019 <br> <br>

 I arrived at the quaint bookstore on Sunday, trying to remain neutral about this coming experience. Being a firm believer in Empiricism and science, I am skeptical about any religious matter; however, simultaneously being an accepting and fair critical thinker, I try to reserve all prejudice on Ayurveda. Torn by this internal conflict, I rested my hand on the handle of the mosaic door. I felt the metallic texture under my hand, albeit the door was made of wood. Opening the door, the bronze wind chimes rang above my head, and the scent of melted wax overwhelmed my senses. My first thought was that this place could burn down at any time, but when I took a closer look, the candles were encased in glass. Better than nothing, was what I told myself. Always evaluating my surroundings, I found this bookstore to have a messy yet comforting set-up. The books were stacked and scattered everywhere. There was just enough space to walk in. This bookstore reminds me of my own house, except we have toys all over the place. Cruising down the aisles with a dwarf’s agility, I was greeted with a warm smile and was lead to me seat. <br><br>


 I sat down with a straight back and started reading my book, Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers, concealing my mild discomfort of being in an unfamiliar space and with unfamiliar people. It didn’t help that these people all knew each other, and were significantly older than I was. My discomfort didn’t last, though. Two slim figures entered the room, a young man and woman. The most peculiar thing is, they represented some sort of symmetry that calmed down the internal conflict. Everything characteristic complemented the other’s. On one hand, the man had fiery ginger hair, on the other hand, the woman had tamed black hair. The man wore black-framed glasses that hid his eyes (kind of shady, to be honest), and the woman had bright plump eyes that lit up her face. The room hushed as they walked in, and they briefly introduced themselves. By this time, I’ve already dismissed some of my pessimism, simply because of the absurd symmetry I recognized between the hosts. <br><br>

 The presentation began with an eventful chant. It was a whole five minutes of closing my eyes with strangers surrounding me. Not exactly my definition of security. What made my squint, however, is not just being insecure around strangers. Instead, it was the weird sounds that we were supposed to make for the chant that bothered me. I withdrew myself after the first minute. <br><br>





 The meaning of Ayurveda, they said, was the knowledge of life. Ayurveda was a modest mode of medicine, as it simply examined the balanced correlation between the human body and the elements of nature. We are all made of organic molecules of nature, and therefore we are all made of the same building blocks that the natural environment around us is made of. Nature has five elements: space, air, fire, water, and earth. These elements each have distinct qualities, and all matter on earth was a result and product of these qualities. Expectedly on the end of that note, they gave examples of some common qualities, such as the quality of being smooth, or sharp, or rough or rounded. <br><br>

 For the next hour of the lecture, the hosts kindly and generously introduced us to the essence of Ayurveda -- the three doshas. <br><br>

 The three doshas were units given to the most common combinations of elements. The combinations included Vata dosha, the combination of space and air; Pitta dosha, the combination of fire and water; and Kapha dosha, the combination of water and earth. The next part of the presentation came to the climax, when they characterized the doshas in relation to human behaviour and patterns. For example, a Vata person would be characterized by irregular physical features, creativity and multi-tasking abilities (although could be imbalanced and become scattered), and anxious, nervous elements; meanwhile, Pitta would have sharp and colourful physical features, passion and determination (although could be imbalanced and become stubborn), and anger, frustration. The Kapha, contrastly, would have thick and prominent features, stable and patient personality, and is easily lethargic. I think I’m a prominent Kapha, although with a mix of Vata and Pitta because on certain days, I’m incredibly touchy and hypersensitive. I enjoyed this part of the presentation, because it’s similar to the buzzfeed quizzes or other little quizzes online, that are very appealing to people my age. I think the always positive results and the placebo effect gives a sense of control and remedies insecurity and boredom. <br><br>

 They have also briefly went over the importance of time to the doshas. Within a day, from 2 A.M. to 6 A.M. is the Vata time, for creativity and alertness; from 6 A.M. to 10 A.M. is the kapha time, for the time to be calm and start off the day with a great mood; and from 10 A.M. to 2 P.M. is the Pitta time, for the energy to get things done. The cycle continues from there. I did not buy into this cycle at all, because the stages do not apply to me. It definitely didn’t help that the hosts were very vague about the cycle and merely brushed past it -- whether its due to time restraints or knowledge restraints, I’m not sure. <br><br>

 The session ended with another meditation, but with hand gestures and other exaggerated chants. This time, I absorbed my senses into the chant. Closing my eyes, humming the chant, inhaling the smell of incense, and listening to my own breathing pace. I have to admit, although most of the session did not work out for me, the only thing I took away was the meditation. To this day, I’m still not sure if it was a placebo or if the meditation really worked. I guess I’ll find out in the next session. <br><br>
